# AndroidCardGame
Goal: Create a card game in Android.

MVP
The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. 


This is the second project I completed in my 16 week intensive programming bootcamp. I designed a card game for android which 
allows a player to play blackjack against a computer opponent. The main challenge for this project was balancing front-end 
and back-end design and making them interact.
